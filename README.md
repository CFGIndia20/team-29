# team-29
There are to django apps in this repo 
1. learn-src
2. employee-src

The learn-src focuses on the par where we need to build a student enrolement system for the student to edication program. Here we have a basic home page with basic details of the site and some infotmation on the course. The student can we 10 or 12th pass the students can also have not have passed 10th std as well.

So the key point in enrolement is the baseline test!
where a set of qurestions are asked if the applicant scores more than 40% then he rr she will be accepted.

So the candidate must be varifief as well as accepted yo enroll fo the provtsm
